Sample project of strategy TD game I've made in Unity3D. Contains C# scripts for: generating game grid, reading XML, spawning enemies, realtime A* navigation for enemies (they can change path dynamicaly), simple projective decal system, tower bulding and tower behavior (shooting at enemies). It's unfinished its here only as sample of my code.



XML script for generating enemies is located in Assets/Resources folder (level1.xml).

Only one type of enemie is avaiable ("zombie").
