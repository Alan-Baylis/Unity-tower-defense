# Unity-tower-defense
Sample project of strategy TD game I've made in Unity3D. Contains C# scripts for: generating game grid, reading XML, spawning enemies, realtime A* navigation for enemies (they can change path dynamicaly), simple projective decal system, tower bulding and tower behavior (shooting at enemies). It's unfinished and I'm uploading it here only as sample of my code.
